let me diagnosis you
0:01
Hey. Hey. Hi. Are you awake? Are you feeling okay?
0:08
You just fell asleep right  in the middle of our session. Has this been happening often? Oh, okay.
0:13
I'll note down fatigue as  one of the symptoms then. Fatigue.
0:20
All right, that concludes our assessment. I'm just going to review my notes before I can give you a diagnosis.
0:26
So based on your symptoms of fatigue, mood swings, headaches, diarrhea,
0:32
you have met the diagnostic  criteria for nostalgia.
0:37
Yes, nostalgia. Why are you laughing? It can be an often fatal disease.
0:43
Many Americans in the Civil  War died from nostalgia. That diagnosis doesn't feel right?
0:49
Well, you said you don't have kids.
0:54
Can you confirm if that's true again? Because these symptoms could also point to lactational insanity.
1:01
Lactational insanity. Lactational insanity.
1:07
Oh, it's when you nurse your  child too much with your breasts and it makes you go cuckoo.
1:12
I know, I know, your husband got diagnosed with neurasthenia and I understand why you think you might have it.
1:18
But as you know, neurasthenia only happens to men. Here, to make things easier for you,
1:24
I will just write your diagnosis as hysteria. That'll make it easier for you to bond with your hysterical lady friends.
questions about psychiatry
1:36
A common motivation for  getting a psychiatric diagnosis is to receive clarity about  your life and yourself.
1:41
Why do I get overwhelmed by noises that others don't seem to notice? Why can't I remember things  that are important to my partner
1:47
no matter how hard I try? If I could just connect these problems to a concrete medical category with
1:52
set symptoms and treatment, then everything will make sense. Unfortunately, many people who go through the
1:58
mental health system will tell you that it's not that smooth of a process. I heard from a friend named viaSUNoli that
2:04
their family doctor referred them to a psychiatrist for PTSD, only for the psychiatrist to diagnose them with BPD.
2:10
Then, as they went through  various forms of therapy and spoke with others diagnosed with BPD, some of them, all being women,
2:17
were getting re-diagnosed with autism. My close friend dug deeper and found a history of debate in psychiatry and philosophy
2:24
about whether BPD should be a diagnostic category. Some people theorize that women make up
2:29
75% of BPD diagnoses because many of them are autistic women who have been misdiagnosed because they
2:36
don't fit the masculine stereotypes around autism. People tend to treat psychiatric categories
2:41
as fixed and deeply real. Many people assume that the realness of these categories is grounded in biology.
2:47
We, as people with ADHD, literally have zero internal motivation.
2:53
Your body goes through something called pruning, where it deletes and gets rid of all of
2:58
the synapses that you do not use. Research has shown that this does not occur
3:03
in people with autism, so we just have too many synapses in places that they're not supposed to be at.
3:09
This is why autistic people  tend to get overstimulated because they have connections to the brain that have been otherwise deleted  in non-autistic people.
3:16
But a quick look through history will show that what we take to be real in a seemingly "objective" science is not
3:22
straightforward at all. Today, nostalgia is understood as a romantic, perhaps bittersweet feeling
3:28
about the past. But during the Civil War in America, you could get diagnosed with  nostalgia or homesickness,
3:34
which was understood as an often fatal disease. In the 19th to early 20th century,
3:39
mothers could get diagnosed with lactational insanity. If a mama's jugs were too big and fruitful,
3:45
they could go insane. Under the belief that women were less reasonable and more similar to animals, ruled by their
3:52
bodies rather than culture, there was a plethora of mental illnesses centered around a woman's body parts:
3:58
their breasts, ovaries, and even noses. Procedures such as removing the clitoris or reshaping a woman's nose
4:04
were prescribed to mentally  disordered female patients. The 19th century also brought about drapetomania,
4:11
the mental illness a black slave had when they wanted to run away from their master. In the view of many white doctors,
4:17
black people were inherently prone to insanity and unreason. So just as how the white  mentally ill population got put
4:24
into asylums for "treatment," slavery was the asylum for black people. To defy slavery was to defy their nature,
4:32
and "mental illness" was a convenient, seemingly apolitical category
4:37
to justify slavery. These diagnoses probably sound ridiculous to you, but all these mental illnesses seemed
4:43
very real to doctors and regular folk living at that time. It might make you take a second look at our own psychiatric categories today.
4:50
What sits in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders -- or the DSM -- today,
4:55
that will be removed in the next 20 years? For example, autism used to be a symptom of "reduced emotions" in schizophrenia,
5:02
but today it stands as an independent diagnosis. A big reason why ADHD exists as a diagnosis
5:08
is because pharmaceutical companies first created the drug Ritalin and then decided they needed a category of
5:14
people to sell the drug to. This naturally leads me to wonder, what purpose a formal diagnosis actually serves.
5:20
The previous directors of the National Institute of Mental Health in America said they hope to one day
5:25
find the precise biological cause of mental illness and disorders. "One of the projects that we're supporting is
5:31
to find biological markers, which are clinically meaningful measures in people that can help us understand  autism spectrum disorder."
5:40
Many leaders in the mental health field believe that psychiatry is reducible to a "sickness of the brain,
5:46
not of the self or society." As a result, much of the Western psychiatric model is highly individualistic.
5:52
It treats psychiatric conditions as isolated from culture. The purpose of a diagnosis, it seems, is to
5:57
tell you that something is going on in your brain and that you can take a drug or attend therapy to
6:02
subdue this individual problem. "Models in the latest fashions are said to look Prozac -deprived.
6:08
Before long, the name was on everyone's tongue. I was on Prozac for a long time. And it seemed everyone was using it."
6:16
Six million Americans using Prozac right now. Receiving a formal diagnosis might grant you better accommodations at work or school,
6:24
but as most people with a mental disability share, it often can work against them. For example, formally there are
6:30
discrimination laws that prohibit employers from mistreating you, firing you, or not hiring you
6:36
on the basis of a disability. But so long as they don't say they're doing that, you're going to find very few
6:41
paths for recourse. Moreover, giving someone accommodations is an individualistic solution
6:47
because psychiatric diagnoses are seen as an individual deviation from what is
6:52
"normal" or "neurotypical." You are autistic purely because of your neurological state.
6:58
And so we will give you a three-day grace period with assignments. Accommodations are there to help individuals conform to "normal,
7:06
neurotypical" expectations. But accommodations do not question expectations themselves.
7:11
As I'll discuss later in this video, the neurotypical ideal is hard to attain for most people, including most "neurotypicals."
7:19
This is an important factor in understanding the growing mainstream interest in neurodivergence. Lastly, this brings us to
7:25
the fundamental philosophical question about the nature of things. Are psychiatric diagnoses real?
the goals of this video
7:31
Before we continue, I want to be clear about the goals of this video. If you're looking for someone to tell you that
7:37
people are just weak these days and the increase of autism and  ADHD diagnoses are fake,
7:42
then this video is not for you. But if you're looking for someone to say that the only reason why autism and ADHD diagnoses
7:49
are increasing is because more autistic and ADHD people are being discovered,
7:54
this is also not the video for you. What I do hope you get out of this video is how these patterns we see
8:00
with autism and ADHD recently represent the complex cultural and historical influences on psychiatry.
8:06
This requires a comprehensive view of history, something often lacking in our fast-paced digital world. I encourage you to step out
8:13
of the shoes of a 21st-century citizen, remove your assumptions about what is natural and normal, what is neurotypical
8:20
versus neurodivergent, so that we can see how psychiatric labels change depending on their cultural utility.
8:26
"It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines
8:32
their consciousness."
the psychiatrization of society
8:51
Us psychiatrists have fought hard to be taken seriously by other health professionals. It wasn't easy to convince the medical field
8:57
that people could suffer from psychological pain separate from the body, or that the insane or mad needed treatment.
9:04
When my great-great-great-great-great -grandfather started hearing voices, he became a prophet.
9:10
Us psychiatrists have also been quite divided as a community. Some of us took up psychoanalysis from Freud.
9:16
Ah, sorry, wrong picture. Freud, which fluctuated in popularity. Others were medical pick-me's and craved
9:24
Dr. Daddy's approval. Please, Dr. Daddy, please, I'm a real science too.
9:29
I look at genes and brain scans. I know how to quantify human experience too.
9:34
Today, the biosocial model is often used in diagnoses, but let's face it, the bio is written first for a reason.
9:41
There's an abundance of medical research today trying to explain mental  conditions as purely biological.
9:47
For example, some researchers are trying to associate certain brain patterns with certain mental disabilities.
9:52
So even if you don't experience symptoms of, say, ADHD, or you don't feel impacted by them,
9:58
if your brain looks a certain way, then you can still be medicated. That way, you can sell your child at risk of
10:04
autism for $300 so you can spend money on pills every month because your doctor said you're at risk for ADHD.
10:12
This is the process of medicalization. "the social process whereby problems that were previously percieved as nonmedical
10:19
become defined, and accordingly treated, as medical problems." Now, I want to make this loud and
10:24
clear for my colleagues and the public. I do not think it is inherently bad to medicalize something.
10:29
It's pretty awesome that we medicalize things like cancer, which people used to believe was caused by not enough sex.
10:36
I am very happy that there's medication to help with psychosis. But not everything works better under a medical model.
10:42
The historical development  of psychiatric conditions shows just how much influence culture has.
10:47
The brain is also immensely complex. I cannot stress that enough. A lot remains unknown about the
10:53
brain compared to all our other organs. Now, according to my list of patients, I have slightly more male patients.
11:01
So why don' we take a look at an example from World War I? Because all boys like war, of course.
11:07
You know, I think it's the penis-shaped bullets. They produce a phallic infatuation.
PTSD, shell shock, & hysteria
11:17
PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder, is one of the more well-known diagnoses in the DSM.
11:23
A paradigmatic case of PTSD is when a soldier returns from war and experiences symptoms such as
11:28
flashbacks and severe anxiety, as though they could be transported back to the battlefield at any moment.
11:33
But the term PTSD did not exist during World War I. Instead, soldiers were being diagnosed with shell shock.
11:39
Now, people tend to think of shell shock as a precursor to PTSD, either claiming that shell shock and
11:45
PTSD are two words for the same thing, or that PTSD is a more refined, more accurate version
11:51
of shell shock. Both thoughts are sort of true, but we've already started off in a flawed assumption.
11:56
Namely, that psychiatric conditions exist objectively out there in the world, and we just
12:01
have to uncover them. It's understandable why people think this way. After all, psychiatry is a medical science,
12:07
and isn't science about discovering objective facts of the world? This is where my recommendation to step
12:13
out of the shoes of a 21st century citizen comes into play. The facade of stable objectivity tends to fall
12:19
apart once you transport yourself into a different historical moment. During World War I, there were only 50 psychiatrists in the
12:25
US military for over 4 million people in the army. As a result, most military personnel were
12:31
being treated by people who had no psychiatric training at all. Back then, psychiatry was not an established branch of medicine
12:37
like it is today. Medical professionals, by and large, treated physical symptoms only. Soldiers knew this, and so their bodies
12:44
subconsciously produced a variety of physical symptoms to communicate their pain, such as paralysis,
12:49
restrictions in joint movement, muteness or deafness, constipation, and insomnia. Even within the military,
12:56
there was a difference in the expression of symptoms depending on your ranking. During the World War I era,
13:01
there was a condition called neurasthenia, which was associated with urban, middle to upper class men who just
13:07
worked too hard. Their strenuous intellectual work was said to cause headaches, fatigue, vertigo, and aches.
13:13
As such, it was desirable to have neurasthenia. Interestingly then, the higher the rank of a military officer,
13:19
the more their symptoms resembled neurasthenia and not shell shock. This is an example of conversion,
13:25
the translation of our feelings and experiences into culturally acceptable language and gestures.
13:30
What might be even more interesting is that doctors initially referred to the soldiers' conditions as hysteria,
13:36
but that didn't end up sticking. Not because the soldiers didn't have hysteria, but in large part because  hysteria implied femininity,
13:44
and that would stigmatize these manly soldiers. So doctors diagnosed soldiers with shell shock,
13:50
not hysteria, so that they wouldn't feel shame in seeking help. Meanwhile, doctors diagnosed female
13:55
nurses on the battlefield with hysteria, even though they had the same symptoms as the soldiers. If you had shell shock,
14:01
you were considered courageous and injured in combat. You had a damn good reason to be acting up.
14:07
But if you had hysteria, well, you were just weak-willed and overdramatic. We learn an important lesson here.
14:13
Psychiatric conditions are strongly influenced by culture. "The story of any sickness is
14:18
one that doctors and patients weave together, in which they find consensus about what constitutes a culturally legitimate and
14:24
sensible symptom at a particular moment in history." In 1917, it didn't make sense
14:30
to most of society to have psychological wounds, and so soldiers learned how to express
14:35
their symptoms physically. Even though doctors knew that shell shock was just another term for hysteria,
14:40
it was culturally useful for them to have these two different diagnoses. And by culturally useful, I mean useful
14:46
in upholding patriarchal culture. Diagnose "first-class"  citizens like white soldiers with shell shock,
14:51
and "second-class" citizens such as women and immigrants with hysteria. Now, it would be wrong to
14:57
say that the people with shell shock had a completely different condition than people with PTSD today,
15:02
but they also aren't two sides of the same coin. Each diagnosis was created to understand a particular kind of pain
15:09
in a culturally acceptable way. Shell shock existed because of a certain culture, and PTSD exists today because of
15:16
a different culture. Shell shock represents a culture when illnesses were thought to reside only in the body, and only
15:22
white men could have valid deviations from what was "normal." PTSD represents a culture
15:27
where psychological suffering is acknowledged, and all people, not just soldiers, have a valid claim to trauma.
15:33
But although PTSD is widely intelligible in Western societies today, it is not a diagnosis in
15:39
communities that speak about historical trauma. PTSD only exists in an  individualistic culture that
15:45
believes that trauma resides in the individual. What I'm trying to get at with this shell shock PTSD example is similar to
15:51
how in ancient Greece, it was common practice for an older man and a younger man to have a romantic and/or sexual relationship.
15:58
But it's not 100% accurate to call them gay, because they didn't see man-to-man relationships as constituting
16:05
a sexual identity. Engaging in "gay" behavior didn't turn you into a type of person called "gay."
16:11
You were just mentor and mentee. A man from ancient Greece and a gay person today share
16:17
behavioral and emotional patterns, just as how people with shell shock and people with PTSD share
16:23
behavioral and emotional patterns. But these two groups of people interpreted and expressed  their experiences differently.
16:28
Now I'm going to get a little abstract here on because it's theory time, but bear with me. What theory grounds the examples
16:35
we've been talking about? If it helps to understand what I'm asking, you can picture the differentiation many people make between theory and application.
16:42
We've analyzed the shell shock PTSD hysteria case, which is an implied example, but what theory is it in application of?
diagnoses as cultural concepts
16:54
"Colonial Hills Hospital is located in northwest San Antonio. Over the years it has come to symbolize hope for those who are drawn
17:00
to its professional caring environment." There once was a psychiatrist named Frantz Fanon. During the Algerian revolution,
17:07
Fanon was stationed in the psychiatric hospital of Blinda Joinville of Algeria, where he treated patients from
17:13
both the French and the Algerian side. But he ended up resigning from the psychiatric hospital.
17:18
He saw psychiatry as ill-suited for what it claimed to do. Psychiatry supposedly was
17:23
a :medical technique" to help integrate people into society so that they could
17:28
"no longer be a stranger to their environment." But it failed to do this because Algeria had a social structure of
17:34
"systemized dehumanization." When others determine what a "true" human or woman or French citizen is,
17:41
how could you be anything but a stranger to your environment?
17:54
Let me show you what I mean. I'm going to conduct what's called the thematic aperception test or TAT on you.
18:00
See this photo? Okay. Take your time to look at it, pause the video if you'd like,
18:05
and simply let your imagination run free. Think about what's going on in the photo. Now tell me what you see.
18:12
What I'm looking for in your answer is to see whether you can create a coherent narrative about the
18:17
photo and whether you are perceptually skilled. Can you make up a story that makes sense? Do you pick up on all of the visual details
18:24
in the photo? Now this might seem like an unbiased test. I didn't place any constraints on what you were to do.
18:30
I just told you to imagine something, anything. However you like. I didn't have one right answer
18:35
I was looking for. Yet can you guess what photos were always chosen when Fanon practiced TAT on
18:40
his Algerian patients? They were always photos of white French people in France.
18:45
"Colonialism tries to craft the imagination of the Muslim woman as if she were European."
18:51
Under oppressive social conditions, psychiatry worked to impose oppressive habits on to its patients.
18:57
Diagnosing someone with hysteria made her hysterical. It imposed this identity of
19:02
hysterical on to someone. I had a friend once share with me their experience of receiving multiple
19:07
diagnoses throughout their life. When they were diagnosed with depression, they interpreted all their feelings and actions
19:13
through the framework of a depressed patient. They couldn't get tasks done on time because they were low on energy.
19:18
They couldn't get out of bed unless they took antidepressants. A few years later they were told by psychiatrists,
19:24
you are not depressed, you just have ADHD. Suddenly everything in their life was interpreted through the framework of ADHD.
19:31
They couldn't get tasks done on time because of ADHD time blindness. They couldn't get out of bed unless they took Vyvanse.
19:37
This is not to discredit the value people find in diagnoses. We need categories to make sense of
19:43
the world and ourselves. Categories track our cultural values. I am not accusing people with autism or
19:49
ADHD or OCD of lying. Heck, I'm a psychiatrist. I'd be put out of business if I thought that.
19:55
Differences in how people interpret social interactions, how they handle emotions and so forth,
20:00
and the hardships they face because of these differences are real. Some people really do have sensory sensitivities that others don't.
20:08
Some people genuinely struggle with verbal communication. But how we group symptoms together, what makes sense as a symptom,
20:14
and what symptoms are expressed, are culturally and historically dependent. Again, autism used to just be a
20:21
symptom of schizophrenia. American doctors once saw the desire of a slave to escape from their master as a medical symptom.
20:28
In World War I, high-ranking  versus low-ranking soldiers expressed different symptoms depending on
20:33
what was expected of their social class. There's a tendency to think of history as the past, where people were
20:39
just weird and wrong. But the present is part of history. Yesterday has now become history.
20:44
And so is this very moment where you're watching me on a digital device. We cannot understand current psychiatric trends
20:51
without this historical awareness. "President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary
neurodivergence today
20:56
Robert O'Kennedy Jr. have both said that it's critical to find the cause of autism. In a statement today, Kennedy said, quote,
21:03
'the HHS is assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research
21:08
on the origins of the epidemic,' as he calls it." With all this talk about neurodivergence online,
21:14
you've likely heard of its supposed opposite. Neurotypicality. Neurotypicals act "normal" or exhibit "standard" forms of behavior.
21:21
Neurodivergence deviate from this standard. But what exactly is expected of a neurotypical?
21:27
"Hi. And how are you? I'm good. And how are you?
21:32
Yes. Some weather we're having."
21:52
Okay, so the neurotypical excels, or at least does fine, under the 9-5 cubicle workday. They don't struggle
21:58
with adhering to social norms of expression. They can regulate their emotions by themselves. They...
22:04
Wait, who is actually this perfect? "Where are the neurotypicals?
22:11
What are they doing? Where-who, who are they, what do they act like?"
22:16
What becomes apparent is that neurotypicality is an ideal, a culturally oppressive standard
22:22
that harms most people, including neurotypicals. Devon Price, a social psychologist and professor
22:27
who is also autistic, makes an analogy between neurotypicality and heteronormativity. Heteronormativity obviously hurts
22:34
queer people the most, but it also hurts hetero people. Heteronormativity is not just the expectation to like someone of
22:40
the opposite sex. It also involves the right expectations about how to like them. A boy and a girl meet.
22:46
They start dating. The boy fulfills the masculine role, and the girl contributes her feminine energy.
22:51
After a few years, they get married, move in together, and stay together for the rest of their lives.
22:56
Many people who are heterosexual deviate from this standard and also feel shame because of it.
23:02
Maybe you don't want to get married and have people question whether you truly love each other. When the girlfriend makes more money
23:07
or does more traditionally masculine roles, the girlfriend gets judged for not having self-respect, and the boyfriend gets judged for not
23:14
being a proper boyfriend. Similarly, neurotypicality hurts neurodivergent folk the most,
23:19
but it also hurts neurotypical folk. The expectation to be a totally self-sufficient individual
23:24
who always acts "rationally" is unsustainable for everyone. It is common to feel
23:30
distress after a traumatic event, or to feel anxious before a job interview, but now people feel like
23:35
they only have a legitimate claim to pain and hardship if they have a diagnosis like autism or anxiety.
23:41
The dominance of psychiatric language is resulting in what philosophers of knowledge have called contributory injustice.
23:48
Concepts often improve our knowledge, creating the concept of postpartum depression, for example,
23:53
helped many mothers understand why they were feeling so terrible, and prevented people from blaming mothers for not being
23:59
motherly enough. But psychiatric language now dominates so many aspects of life
24:04
that people struggle to see the world through any other concept. This is an epistemic injustice,
24:09
an injustice in our ability to know and understand things. People cannot understand things in a
24:15
non-psychiatric way. "Everyone in my life is white, and they go, that guy's autistic. I go, I agree. Exactly!
24:20
No, no, but we don't do that in like other cultures. What cultures do we not do that in? Latin culture, we just go, that's Jose
24:26
and he likes to sweep. Like, you just let that guy rock. Raul's just good at numbers. You just want to be like,
24:31
let's be descriptive without having to necessarily put a label on it. Yes." As someone closely connected with the
24:37
neurodivergent label, it's understandable why a good chunk of neurodivergent folk are frustrated with the loose
24:43
usage of categories like autism and ADHD. It undermines how difficult having autism and ADHD actually is.
24:50
It makes everything "not normal" equivalent to autistic. God, the amount of times I've seen
24:56
someone on social media just dressed a little quirky, or maybe they don't speak super smoothly,
25:01
and there's tons of comments joking, is he acoustic? It has even led autistic individuals to
25:07
be romantically fetishized. "I like him. I that autistic man.
25:12
And, would I be wrong if I asked him at dinner, 'is you autistic?' Cause, I like that."
25:17
But when autistic folk do not fit into this fetishized image of autism, they are belittled as they historically have been.
25:24
The seemingly increased acceptance towards autism is only an acceptance of the symptoms that the culture
25:29
now deems unproblematic. But at the end of the day, it would be misguided to point our fingers at individual actors.
flashbang* psychiatry & productivity
25:36
Psychiatry cannot be separated from historical values of productivity and work. For centuries, psychiatric asylums existed
25:43
to confine anyone who is generally disruptive and unproductive. Lawbreakers, the unemployed,
25:48
the unhoused, the physically disabled, and the strange were all put into the same asylums.
25:54
What mattered was their shared lack of contribution to economic production. As such, when asylums were specifically
26:00
designed for the insane in the 18th century, doctors define diagnoses primarily in terms of the failure
26:06
to function to serve the economy, a view that still lives on today in psychiatry.
26:11
Several diagnoses are still described as functional impairments. Diagnoses like autism and ADHD
26:17
are split between "low functioning"  and "high functioning." But think about what constitutes functioning.
26:22
The autistic person who works 80 hours a week at a prestigious tech company but can barely find energy to cook at home
26:29
or has sensory meltdowns at home is considered high functioning because their problems don't interfere with
26:35
economic productivity. They're the good ones, you know, they keep their autism private. Their intense concentration on work
26:42
is not a medical symptom called hyperfixation because to be overworked is normal,
26:47
respectable even. "Low functioning" autistic people might need regular support communicating with others
26:53
and their non-productive  interest in Ikea furniture is labeled a hyperfixation, but they could
26:58
be 10 times happier than someone labeled "high functioning." More and more people are identifying with neurodivergent labels because
27:05
the capitalist expectations around work and productivity are getting harder to meet and the culture has failed to
27:11
provide people with language beyond psychiatry to understand this. The eight hour workday is  not great for most people
27:17
regardless of where they sit on the neurotypical to neurodivergent spectrum, especially since most people can't make a
27:23
comfortable income off just one job anymore. They now gotta adopt 12 hour work days or find some sort of side gig
27:30
on the weekend. With most people being highly dependent on their phone, we are constantly tapped into tragic stories all over the world.
27:37
We are constantly thinking about how others judge us on social media. Did I pick a cool caption?
27:42
Why don't I look as pretty as her? Why did someone call me cringe on my tiktok when I didn't think it was cringe at all?
27:48
Performing a specific image of ourselves is a regular occurrence in the average person's life. That's why Devon Price says
27:54
unmasking is for everyone. Autistic and non-autistic people mask in different ways, but unmasking benefits all.
28:01
A lot of people are stuck on a treadmill of following popular norms and expectations without truly
28:06
being in touch with themselves. Improving work conditions to be more accessible and flexible is also good for everyone.
28:13
Autistic folk require  accommodations of a certain kind, but the general observation  that the workplace needs
28:19
improvement is true for most people. "To acknowledge the needs of autistic workers is to listen to the canaries in the coal mine.
28:26
Our sensitivities and needs help lay bare just how unfair many work expectations are,
28:31
even for neurotypical people." For these reasons, it's not uncommon for psychiatrists to diagnose people
28:37
with whatever they think will get them the services they would most benefit from. The DSM organizes diagnoses
28:43
into clean separate categories, but many psychiatrists know that diagnoses are not actually distinct in
28:49
these clean ways. There is so much overlap between ADHD and autism, BPD and CPTSD,
28:55
anxiety and depression, etc, etc. Moreover, a medical or psychological condition
29:01
only exists if money is funneled into research, clinics, and studies that steadily
29:06
produce these diagnoses. So sometimes, if one disorder becomes less stigmatized or is more
29:11
attractive for research grants, it may be diagnosed more, which causes the number of other diagnoses
29:17
with overlapping symptoms to decrease. As such, the total number of diagnoses or people using disability services
29:24
might not actually change, even if the media makes it seem like everyone is autistic or has ADHD now.
29:30
Crucially, this means that, as a diagnosis becomes increasingly useful for a more diverse group of individuals,
29:36
the differences between people with and without the diagnosis can decrease. So, are psychiatric diagnoses real?
so... are psychiatric diagnoses real?
29:43
Yes and no. The diagnoses and symptoms we deem "real" are informed by what is
29:49
culturally sensible and or useful. So, if you think "real" means a biological,
29:54
universal, and eternal entity, then no, psychiatric diagnoses aren't real.
29:59
But that's the wrong way of looking at things. You're going to find that practically nothing is real under that definition.
30:05
Autism, ADHD, OCD, PTSD. These categories coincide with how
30:10
Western culture makes sense of the world and the individual. They are real because they function as real,
30:15
and that's enough. And if in 50 years the DSM looks totally different, I wouldn't be too surprised.
30:21
But that doesn't change what is real for people right now.
30:28
There's a lot of research I did that didn't make it into this video, but I could only fit so much in one video in a coherent way.
30:34
You can check out my research notes on Patreon. I also make short explanations of different philosophy papers or book chapters
30:41
on Patreon in a series called The Brain Nourishment Series. I'd appreciate your support over there,
30:47
and it's lots of fun if you can join the Discord. We've been playing Jackbox Party recently and trapping each other in moral dilemmas.
30:54
I'm sure many of you, like myself, also feel like the world is an increasingly volatile place,
30:59
which makes it difficult to keep up with the news. It doesn't help that most people get news through social media,
31:04
but social media sites are known to shadow ban certain news topics, keep you within your algorithm's bubble,
31:10
and distract you from serious news with brain rot. I tell you this because the sponsor of this video is Ground News,
31:16
but I'm not going to act like Ground News is perfect. No news site can be perfect, especially with the goals
31:21
that Ground News has. Ground News wants to be a tool to help you be more conscious of bias, to widen the scope of the
31:27
news stories you encounter, and to make it easier for you to access articles. And it does just that, as a tool.
31:33
Ground News is both an app and a website that collects related articles from more than 50,000 sources
31:38
across the world and political spectrum, so you can compare how different outlets cover the same story.
31:44
You can see the different headlines chosen by different news outlets for the same story, which helps you be more critical
31:49
about their intentions. You can read which news stories are being underreported on by left or right leaning news outlets in the blind spot feed.
31:57
You can tailor your feed to  specific topics or individuals and read them all without ever  leaving the app or website.
32:03
There's even a Ground News browser extension now that I use to help give me  a summary of information at the top of any article I open.
32:10
At the end of the day, Ground News is a tool to help you be critical and informed about the world. A car helps you get from point A to B,
32:17
but the car won't do it by itself. You gotta learn how to use the car to help you. Same with Ground News.
32:22
It's a great tool for critical thinking, but you should also critically  think as you use it. I've been using Ground News for two years now?
32:30
Two? Three years? It's been a long time. I don't know. I find it helpful, and if you want to try it out,

psychiatric diagnosis in your life or not, regardless of whether you know someone who's had a psychiatric diagnosis or not,
33:02
I'd love to hear your thoughts about what you think about psychiatry and the mental health system.
33:07
Do you have any personal experiences you would want to share? Is there something important that you think I missed out on?
33:13
Let me know. Thank you so much for watching. Let's keep talking, and I hope to hear from you soon.
