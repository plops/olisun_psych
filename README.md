# AI Fact Check: The Social Ontology of Madness

This repository documents an AI-assisted fact-checking workflow analyzing a video essay on the social construction of psychiatric diagnosis. The project moves from raw transcription to deep research, drafting, and finally typesetting a professional report in both English and German using [Typst](https://typst.app/).

## 📂 Project Structure

The filenames follow the chronological workflow of the fact-checking process:

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **00_transcript.md** | The raw transcript of the source video. |
| **01_research.md** | Individual research sections generated by Google AI Mode. This contains specific queries and responses regarding historical claims (e.g., *Nostalgia*, *Drapetomania*) and neurobiological claims (e.g., synaptic pruning). |
| **02_factcheck.md** | The consolidated draft article synthesizing the research into a coherent review panel format. |
| **03_factcheck.typ** | **(English)** The Typesetting source code. |
| **03_factcheck.pdf** | **(English)** The final compiled fact-check report. |
| **04_factcheck_de.typ** | **(German)** The translated Typesetting source code. |
| **04_factcheck_de.pdf** | **(German)** The final compiled fact-check report. |
| **setup03_compile.sh** | Shell script to compile the Typst documents. |

## 🔍 Main Conclusions

The review panel (simulated expert persona) found the video's central thesis to be **highly robust** and supported by extensive medical scholarship.

*   **Historical Accuracy:** Claims regarding obsolete diagnoses like *Nostalgia* (fatal homesickness), *Lactational Insanity*, and *Drapetomania* are historically accurate; these were treated as objective medical realities in their respective eras.
*   **Sociological Context:** The video accurately describes the class stratification of WWI psychiatry (Officers diagnosed with "Neurasthenia" vs. enlisted men with "Hysteria").
*   **Neurobiology:** Claims regarding synaptic pruning deficits in Autism align with current leading scientific theories (e.g., Tang et al., 2014).
*   **Verdict:** The video successfully demonstrates that psychiatric diagnoses are historically contingent constructs rather than immutable biological natural kinds.
